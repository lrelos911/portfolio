      <h3>Blurb About Me</h3>
      <p>My name is Lorenzo Relos. My pronouns are he/him/his. The date today is August 4, 2022. I'm a Computer Science: Game Design major who graduated with a bachelor's degree from the University of California Santa Cruz. I haven't been successful finding a job in the game development industry so I'm taking this course to funnel my preexisting aptitude for programming towards a new skill and an in demand field. I just moved to Washington state with my parents, but within a few months I need to move out. I don't want to be relying on them forever. I need to be able to live independently with a good source of income. I have friends that I'll be moving in with, so I don't have to shoulder the burden of living all on my own. But that will still necessitate getting a job. For that reason I hope to be able to get a job in front end web development with the skills I acquire from taking this course.</p>

      <p>This part can almost serve as a time capsule of where I am right now starting this course. Especially since I'm in a rather tumultuous time of my life. Can't wait to look back on this upon finishing the course and seeing how far I've come, both with my web development experience as well as life progression.</p>
